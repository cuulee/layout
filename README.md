# ktquez/layout

A full-featured Webpack + extend layout + vue-loader setup with hot reload, linting, testing & css extraction.  

> *Using vue-extend-layout package, inspired in layouts of the Nuxt.js*

> This template is Vue 2.0 compatible

## Documentation where this template was based

- [For template webpack](http://vuejs-templates.github.io/webpack): common questions specific to this template are answered and each part is described in greater detail
- [For Vue 2.0](http://vuejs.org/guide/): general information about how to work with Vue, not specific to this template

## Usage

This is a project template for [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli). **It is recommended to use npm 3+ for a more efficient dependency tree.**

``` bash
$ npm install -g vue-cli
$ vue init ktquez/layout my-project
$ cd my-project
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

If port 8080 is already in use on your machine you must change the port number in /config/index.js. Otherwise npm run dev will fail.

## Using layouts

By default, there are 2 layout components in the directory `layouts/`:
- **layouts/default.vue** => Is the default application extend layout
- **layouts/error.vue** => This is the layout for error page

*Both are already configured in the route file*
For example:
```javascript
...
export default new Router({
  mode: 'history',
  base: '/',
  routes: [
    {
      path: '/',
      name: 'Hello',
      component: () => import('@/pages/Hello'),
      // Setting layout when default, is optional, no need to set.
    },
    {
      path: '*',
      name: 'Error',
      meta: {
        layout: 'error' // error layout for route mismatch
      }
    }
  ]
})

```

# Custom extend layout

To create a layout you just need to create a component within the layouts directory and name that component.  

For example:
`layouts/myCustomLayoutLogin.vue`

```vue
<template>
  <div>
    <router-view />
  </div>
</template>

<script>
  export default {
    name: 'myCustomLayoutLogin' // id of the layout
  }
</script>

<style>
/* your style */
</style>
```

And to extend this layout in any the desired route, simply include the property `layout: myCustomLayoutLogin` in meta object of the route.
```javascript
{
  path: '/login',
  name: 'Login',
  component: () => import('@/pages/Login'),
  meta: {
    layout: 'myCustomLayoutLogin' // name of the layout
  }
}
```

**Attention: The value of the `layout` property must be the same as the name of the `myCustomLayoutLogin` component.**
